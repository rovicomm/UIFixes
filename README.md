Minor QOL fixes for SPTarkov

Tarkov is full of annoyances but we can fix them! Sometimes.

✨ New in the latest version!

## Inventory
- Swap items in place! Drag an item over another one and they'll swap positions if possible. Items that already have an interaction with each other (e.g. bullets and magazines) are unaffected.
- Rebind Home/End, PageUp/PageDown to work like they do in every other app ever released in the history of the world.
- Customizable mouse scrolling speed
- Fix item tooltips if your mouse goes through the Quest/FoundInRaid icon (great for MoreCheckmarks)
- Allow found in raid money and ammo automatically stack with non-found-in-raid items (stops containers making extra stacks!). ✨ Top-up too!
- Option to synchronize stash scroll position everywhere your stash is visible

## Traders
- ✨ Autoswitch between buy and sell when you click trader items or control-click your own items
- ✨ Insure items directly from the context menu
- ✨ Autoselect quest items when turning in

## Flea market 
- Filter history remembers previous searches and filters, and adds a new BACK button to return to the previous results.
- Auto-expand categories when there's space to do so
- ✨ Locked trader item tooltip reveals which specific quest will unlock it
- Option to keep the Add Offer window open after placing your offer
- Set prices in the Add Offer window by clicking the min/avg/max market prices
- ✨ Autoselect Similar checkbox is remembered across sessions and application restarts

## Doors
- Remove the unimplemented actions like "Bang & clear" that, lets face it, are never going to happen anyway.

## Item bar
- Fix the keybind for weapons always showing up as 1, 2, and 3. Now shows your actual keybind like every other slot.

## Weapon presets/modding
- Enable zooming with mousewheel
- Skips needless unsaved changes warnings when navigating to another screen from a weapon preset (optional, defaults ON)
- Skip all unsaved changes warnings when closing a weapon preset (optional, defaults OFF)

## Inspect windows
- Show the total stats (including sub-mods) when inspecting mods (optional, toggleable *in* the inspect pane with a new button!)
- See stats change as you add/remove mods, with color-coded deltas!
- Remember last window size when you change it, with restore button to resize to default
- Move left and move right buttons to quickly snap inspect windows to the left or right half of the screen, for easy comparisons. ✨ Now with keybinds
- Auto-expand descriptions when possible (great for showing extra text from mods like Item Info)

## Hideout
- Remember window state when you leave hideout without closing (e.g. when searching for a recipe item on flea)

## Mail
- Skips "You can return to this later" warnings when not transferring all items (optional, defaults ON)
- "Receive All" button no longer shows up when there is nothing to receive.

## Misc
- Confirm dialogs with Return/Enter/Space instead of just Y
- Many little UI tweaks to tighten up the graphics

## More to come... ?
