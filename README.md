Minor QOL fixes for SPTarkov

Tarkov is full of annoyances but we can fix them! Sometimes.

✨ New in the latest version!

## Inventory
- Swap items in place! Drag an item over another one and they'll swap positions if possible. Items that already have an interaction with each other (e.g. bullets and magazines) are unaffected.
- Rebind Home/End, PageUp/PageDown to work like they do in every other app ever released in the history of the world.
- Customizable mouse scrolling speed
- Fix item tooltips if your mouse goes through the Quest/FoundInRaid icon (great for MoreCheckmarks)
- Allow found in raid money and ammo automatically stack with non-found-in-raid items (stops containers making extra stacks!)
- ✨ Option to synchronize stash scroll position everywhere your stash is visible

## Doors
- Remove the unimplemented actions like "Bang & clear" that, lets face it, are never going to happen anyway.

## Item bar
- Fix the keybind for weapons always showing up as 1, 2, and 3. Now shows your actual keybind like every other slot.

## Weapon presets/modding
- Enable zooming with mousewheel
- Skips needless unsaved changes warnings when navigating to another screen from a weapon preset (optional, defaults ON)
- Skip all unsaved changes warnings when closing a weapon preset (optional, defaults OFF)

## Inspect windows
- Show the total stats (including sub-mods) when inspecting mods (optional, toggleable *in* the inspect pane with a new button!)
- See stats change as you add/remove mods, with color-coded deltas!
- ✨ Remember last window size when you change it, with restore button to resize to default
- ✨ Move left and move right buttons to quickly snap inspect windows to the left or right half of the screen, for easy comparisons
- ✨ Auto-expand descriptions when possible (great for showing extra text from mods like Item Info)

## Hideout
- ✨ Remember search text when you leave hideout without closing (e.g. when searching for a recipe item on flea)

## Mail
- Skips "You can return to this later" warnings when not transferring all items (optional, defaults ON)
- "Receive All" button no longer shows up when there is nothing to receive.

## Misc
- Confirm dialogs with Return/Enter/Space instead of just Y

## More to come... ?
